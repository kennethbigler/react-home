This is a website created by me to represent my resume, as well as for me to practice new technologies.

View the site at [kennethbigler.com](http://www.kennethbigler.com/)

## Usage

This website was made to learn, and demonstrate information about Ken Bigler. Most of my users are here for the [Blood on the Clocktower tool](https://www.kennethbigler.com/#/games/botc).

## Local Development

For development you need to be on [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/index.html) (a requirement of [vite@5](https://vitejs.dev/)).

To run this code locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
