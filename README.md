This is a website created by me to represent my resume. I use ReactJS and it is hosted by GitHub Pages.

# Setup
For development you need to be on Node >= v6.

To run this code locally:

``` bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Feel free to make commits locally, but before creating a PR, run `./deploy.sh` to prepare the code for gh-pages.
