      Objective:
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Get as close to 21 as you can, without going over. Each card is worth
      it&apos;s number, J/Q/K are worth 10, and an Ace is worth 11 unless you go
      over 21, then it is worth 1.

    </Typography>
    <Typography>

      Splitting Pairs:
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      When you are dealt a pair of cards of the same rank, you are allowed to
      split into two separate hands and play them independently. You will match
      your bet for the second hand. A double after a split is ok
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <Typography variant="h5">
      Resplitting:
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      When you get additional pairs in the first two cards of a hand you can
      resplit. Typically a player is allowed to split up to 3 times (delt 4 of a
      kind).
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <Typography variant="h5">
      Splitting Aces:
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Player is limited to drawing only one additional card on each Ace. If you
      draw a ten-valued card on one of your split Aces, the hand is not
      considered a Blackjack (it is treated as a normal 21). You can re-split
      Aces.
