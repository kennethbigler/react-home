Accessibility is often an afterthought, with many available design systems having numerous errors. What are Design Systems? A design system is a collection of components which work like building blocks to build a web application. Why is it important for a Design System to be Accessible? Because Design Systems are the building blocks of an application, they are used in all facets of all Intuit products. Given their prevalence throughout the applications, it is critical that they meet the highest standards of accessibility. If my Design System is Accessible, am I done worrying about accessibility? Yes, while building a strong foundation is essential, it is not enough to ensure that the components are used correctly, or that other custom elements are built correctly. What design system do we have here at Intuit? We have 1 design system: a component library that follows a set of standards compiled by designers, product managers, and us, the accessibility team. We also have 8 different products to design for. We solve for this by making our design system dynamic, so that certain elements can change while the base component remains the same. What special accessibility considerations have been made for Intuit? Accessibility is a part of the design process, and is taken into consideration before implementation has even begun. On top of this, I am currently adding automation testing for accessibility all throughout the design system."}]}]}]},{color:i[900],degree:"External Company Presentations",subtitle:"",years:[{year:"Intuit India Accessibility Summit",quarters:[{quarter:"Master of Ceremonies",classes:[{catalog:"Date",name:"November 9, 2022"}]}]}]},{color:i[900],degree:"Hackathons",subtitle:"",years:[{year:"GigNow - Hacking the Gig Economy Now",quarters:[{quarter:"GraphHoppers",classes:[{catalog:"Date",name:"Nov. 16, 2018"},{catalog:"Prizes",name:"1st Place"},{catalog:"Project",name:"initial implementation of GraphQL to replace GigNow APIs"}]}]},{year:"Accenture Hackathon Games",quarters:[{quarter:"Feedbat",classes:[{catalog:"Date",name:"Oct. 18 - 19, 2014"},{catalog:"Prizes",name:"Best Use of the PubNub API, Best Use of the Amazon Store API"},{catalog:"Project",name:"“feedbat”, an image-sharing web application for mobile devices to get anonymous feedback on various images (likes / dislikes / comments)"}]}]}]}];export{d as p,u as s};
